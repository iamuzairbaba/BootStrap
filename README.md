# BootStrap

One day, amidst a period I considered unproductive in my life, I made a decision to embark on a journey of learning HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
These were challenging times when I found myself engaged in just one pursuitâ€”wasting time. Hence, the title of my book reflects that phase.
Adopting a playway method, I delved into the intricacies of coding, albeit with the acknowledgment that there may be imperfections in my work. I extend my apologies in advance for any issues that may arise.
While my exposure to HTML was modest and CSS usage was limited, I extensively employed Bootstrap in my learning process. Looking ahead, my aspirations include delving into JavaScript and integrating additional elements into my website.
I don't see a need where you would need to install any new tech in your computer to use this.
